# Lyrics
Stacie's scrum (has got it goin on)
Don't blame it on the scrumshine
Scrumbody once told me (the world ain't gonna roll me)
Scrum - as you are
So scrum on, scrum on, do the locomotion with me
Scrum on over to my place (hey there, we're havin a party)
Here comes the scrum
I'm walking on scrumshine
Every-body hurts... scrum-times...
And we'll have scrum scrum scrum til your daddy takes your T-bird awaaaay
Scrum together, right now, over me
Find - me - scrumbody to loooove
You're scrumbelievable (instrumental)
Truly scrumptious - you're truly, truly scrumptious
Scrumpty dumpty (sat on the wall)
Scrumpah-pah scrumpah-pah (that's how it goes)

# Film/show titles
Scrum mothers do ave em
Scrum and scrummer
Scrummer and dumber
Scrumdog millionaire

# Other puns
Yo ho ho and a bottle of scrum
Can't scrum and chew gum at the same time
Set phasers to scrum
Long long scrum and my face goes numb
Scrum of a gun!
More than the scrum of its parts
Grumpy scrumpy
